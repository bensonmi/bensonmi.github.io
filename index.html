        <p>Hello2! I'm Mike; I'm currently an industrial programmer working with PLCs and have 26 years of experience.</p>
        <p>I am also a student at SNHU, and I'm getting a bachelor of computer science degree.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>I started in the Computer Science program in January of 2018, studying for as long as five years. I plan to join the program to improve my background in the programming and development of applications and web services. This effort was because of my passion for working with computers and technology, performing web development, and have led some IT projects and implementing IT infrastructures during my years of practicing Architecture.</p>
        <p>While in the Computer Science Program, I have learned and improved an innumerable number of abilities, skills, and knowledge. I have improved my attention to detail and security mindset as crucial skills to perform as a software engineer and developer. Being organized and cautious in my code development and doing it in simple blocks and testing as part of my workflow help me improve these skills and abilities. Testing is crucial to ensuring a program works and is free of weaknesses and vulnerabilities and becomes more complicated as a project grows in complexity. Acknowledging and adopting a tester mindset and a security mindset are well-required skills and abilities that improve continuously.</p>
        <p>Attention to detail relates to code reviews, security standards, and best practices. Thinking with security in mind and not leaving it to the end is a way to gain a zero-trust ethic and approach that improves my coding skills. By combining code reviews and a security mindset, I can analyze my code and peer's code and look for mistakes and vulnerabilities that I may have missed during my focus on code development. Applying best practices and standards helps me produce formatted, understood, and maintainable software code and systems. In the same way, asking for help from peers to look at and review my work is another way to improve my abilities and skills in attention to detail and communication. Looking at my work with a fresh set of eyes helps me quickly discover overlooked mistakes.</p>
        <p>I learn the importance of the Software Development Lifecycle and how to apply project management strategies working on a large-scale project as part of a team or as an individual. Many logistics go into planning a large project and coordinating with peers and team members. Understanding clients' needs as part of SDLC help to translate those needs into algorithms and pseudocode that result in a program. That incredible knowledge brings gratefulness and satisfaction when putting them into practice. All of the above soft skills and others like creativity, communication, and time management have been improved and increased during my years of study and professional work.</p>
